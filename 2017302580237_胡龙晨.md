# Network distributed computing the second homework
## 1.P6
(a)Propagation delay：d<sub>prop</sub> = m/s

(b)Transmission time：d<sub>trans</sub> = L/R

(c)Delay：d<sub>nodal = m/s + L/R

(d)Suppose Host A is starting transmiting the host at t=0, so at t = d<sub>trans</sub>, The last bit of the packet is just leaving A

(e)If d<sub>prop</sub> > d<sub>trans</sub>,at t = d<sub>trans</sub>，The first bit of the packet is in propgation between A and B

(f)If d<sub>prop</sub> < d<sub>trans</sub>,at t = d<sub>trans</sub>，The first bit of the packet is at B

(g)Suppose d<sub>prop</sub> = d<sub>trans</sub>

m = (L*s)/R = 120*2.5×10<sup>8</sup>/56 = 535714.2857m
    
## 2.P25
（a）R*t<sub>prop</sub> = 2Mbpsx20000km/(2.5x108)m/s = 160000

（b）Maximum number of bits on a link：160000 ，which is the value of bandwidth-delay product. The formula is in （e）

（c）The bandwidth-delay product is the maximum number of bits available on any time link. The formula is in （e）

（d）The width of one bit：Length/number = 20000km/160000 =125m ,which is larger than a pitch

（e）Consider maximum number of bits on a link

Suppose there are L bits total , propogation delay is m/s , transmission delay is L/R

Then the percentage of propagation delay to transmission delay is : (m/s)/(L/R) = mR/sL , which is after time of mR/sL , The link is full of bits

Since there are L bits, the maximum number of bits on any time link is : L * mR/sL = mR/s , which is the bandwidth-delay product

Width：m / (mR/s) = s/R

## 3.P29
（a）Propagation delay： d<sub>prop</sub> = 36000km / 2.4*10<sup>8</sup> = 0.15s

（b）R * d<sub>prop</sub> = 10M * 0.15s = 1500000

（c）Since photos are taken every minute, the previous line of photos should be transmitted within 60s . So it works out to be 6 x 108 bits in 60 seconds
